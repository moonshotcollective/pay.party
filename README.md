## Summary

**pay.party** is a tool used to distribute compensation to team members based on democratic principles.

Using Pay.Party, A user can create and fund a pay.party election, assigning candidate and voter roles to any number of Ethereum addresses. Address participants can vote on their peers to determine the compensation distribution from the elections funding pool.

When a pay.party has ended, the funds are distributed to each candidate based on the election outcome, and users are notified of their dispersement..

### How it works

Upon creating a pay.party election, a creator adds participants by assigning any number of addresses a voter and/or candidate role, the election funding token and amount, the number of votes every voter gets, and other related metadata (name, description, etc.). If an address has a _voter_ role, the address participates by voting on candidates. If, however, an address has a _candidate_ role, the address participates by voting _and_ being voted on in which case they may receive a portion of the election pool's funding.
